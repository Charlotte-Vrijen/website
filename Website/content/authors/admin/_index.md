Charlotte Vrijen is a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Groningen. Her main research interest is <b>positive bias</b>, i.e., the phenomenon that many people see the world more brightly and more positive than it really is. Positive bias may protect us from developing mental health problems.

During her PhD, Charlotte investigated the absence of positive bias in adolescence as an underlying mechanism of depression. She combined longitudinal data collected every 2 to 3 years with more fine-grained momentary assessments, laboratory tasks, and biomarkers. 

Charlotte's current research focuses on the intergenerational transmission of social experiences. Her aim for the future is to combine both lines of research and investigate when and how individual differences in positive bias arise, and what role genetic vulnerabilities and parenting play.  

Charlotte is passionate about improving scientific practice. She is a member of her departmentâ€™s Ethics Committee and of the Open Science Community Groningen, where she gives pre-registration workshops. Examples of <a href="https://osf.io/gxmy3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">open science practices in her work</a>  are pre-registrations, sharing syntax and data, and publishing open access.
