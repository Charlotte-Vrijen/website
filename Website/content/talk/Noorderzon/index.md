abstract: At Noorderzon 2019 I co-organized the Noorderlichten activity ‘Like parent, like child?’. Noorderlichten is an event to bring scientific research outside academia and give children and other non-scientists the opportunity to experience what it is like to do research. During our activity, children and their parents were invited to investigate for themselves how similar they were in looks, physics, character and emotions. The posters we made for the assignments and to explain the influence of genetics and parenting have been made publicly available on OSF (https://osf.io/6f59z/).
