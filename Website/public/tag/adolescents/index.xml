      <title>Intergenerational transmission</title>
      <link>https://charlottevrijen.com/project/intergenerational-transmission/</link>

      <guid>https://charlottevrijen.com/project/intergenerational-transmission/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;My postdoc is part of &lt;a href=&#34;https://kretschmertina.wordpress.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&gt;Dr. Tina Kretschmer&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/a&gt; ERC funded project &lt;a href=&#34;https://kretschmertina.wordpress.com/erc-cape/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&gt;Ghosts from the Past: Consequences of Adolescent Peer Experiences across Contexts and Generations (CAPE)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this project we investigate whether and how peer experiences are transmitted a) to adult friendships and romantic relationships, and b) across generations, i.e., passed on to offspring, to shed light on how the “ghosts from peer past” affect young adults’ relationships and their children’s early social development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our methods include examining longitudinal links between adolescent peer and young adult close relationships and test whether parents’ peer experiences affect offspring’s peer experiences. Psychological functioning, parenting, temperament, genetic, and epigenetic transmission mechanisms are examined separately and in interplay. We utilise data from &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.trails.nl/en/home/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&gt;the TRAILS cohort&lt;/a&gt; that has been followed since age 11. To study intergenerational transmission, the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.trails.nl/en/hoofdmenu/participants/trails-next/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&gt;TRAILS NEXT&lt;/a&gt; sample of participants with children is substantially extended.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Positive bias and mental health</title>
      <link>https://charlottevrijen.com/project/positive-bias-and-mental-health/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 01 Dec 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://charlottevrijen.com/project/positive-bias-and-mental-health/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;My main line of research concerns positive bias, i.e., the phenomenon that many people see the world more brightly and more positive than it really is, and whether and at what ages individual differences in positive bias are associated with differences in mental and social functioning. In this project I combine longitudinal data collected every 2-3 years with more fine-grained momentary assessments, laboratory tasks, and biomarkers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the key findings of this project is that absence of positive bias during early and mid-adolescence predict onset of depression later in life. My aim for future research is to investigate when and how individual differences in positive bias arise, and what role genetic vulnerabilities and parenting play.&lt;/p&gt;
