[{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Charlotte Vrijen is a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Groningen. Her main research interest is positive bias, i.e., the phenomenon that many people see the world more brightly and more positive than it really is. Positive bias may protect us from developing mental health problems.\nDuring her PhD, Charlotte investigated the absence of positive bias in adolescence as an underlying mechanism of depression. She combined longitudinal data collected every 2 to 3 years with more fine-grained momentary assessments, laboratory tasks, and biomarkers.\nCharlotte\u0026rsquo;s current research focuses on the intergenerational transmission of social experiences. Her aim for the future is to combine both lines of research and investigate when and how individual differences in positive bias arise, and what role genetic vulnerabilities and parenting play.\nCharlotte is passionate about improving scientific practice. She is a member of her department’s Ethics Committee and of the Open Science Community Groningen, where she gives pre-registration workshops. Examples of open science practices in her work are pre-registrations, sharing syntax and data, and publishing open access.\n  Download her CV.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"","section":"authors","summary":"Charlotte Vrijen is a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Groningen.

Previous meta- analyses only included research up to 2014 and were limited to drug use. Electronic databases were searched on March 14, 2019. We included peer- reviewed articles and dissertations in English that reported on associations between bullying perpetration in childhood or adolescence and later use of drugs, alcohol, or tobacco. Three-level multilevel random effects models were used to account for dependency between effects from the same sample. Separate models were estimated for the effects of bullying perpetration and combined bullying perpetration- victimization, for the different types of substance use, and for unadjusted and adjusted effects. Egger tests and p-curve analyses were performed to assess the likelihood of reporting or publication bias. In total 215 effects were included from 28 publications, reporting on 22 samples with a total of 28,477 participants. Bullying perpetration was associated positively with all types of substance use, also after adjusting for confounders. Childhood bullying was more strongly associated with later alcohol and tobacco use than adolescent bullying. For bully-victims, results were more heterogeneous and effects seemed weaker compared to \"pure\" bullies. The findings of this study suggest that, compared to their non-bullying peers, bullying children and adolescents have a higher risk of drugs, alcohol, and tobacco use later on. Our finding that childhood bullying was more strongly linked to alcohol and tobacco use later in life than adolescent bullying, may be explained by evidence that, contrary to childhood bullying, adolescent bullying may be a strategic and functional response to acquire a dominant position in the peer group, not necessarily related to negative outcomes.","tags":null,"title":"Meta-analysis on childhood and adolescent peer bullying perpetration and later substance use (oral presentation)","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Daan Ornée","Charlotte Vrijen\"","Yoram Kunkels"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1604408400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1604408400,"objectID":"6b0e4fb7a89e8dd24fa66f93a6f34028","permalink":"https://charlottevrijen.com/talk/pre-registrationkickoff/","publishdate":"2020-11-03T13:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/pre-registrationkickoff/","section":"talk","summary":"The Open Science Community Groningen (OSCG) and the Young Enthusiastic Social Scientists of Behavioural and Social Sciences (YESS BSS) organize information lectures and bi-monthly Q\u0026A's on pre-registration on a structural basis.

Part of the reason for this gap in the literature is that the instruments that are used to assess reward responsiveness and optimism in adolescents and adults are usually not suitable for young children. Two behavioral tasks to assess reward learning, a questionnaire on reward responsiveness, and a questionnaire on optimism/pessimism will be tested on their feasibility and reliability in children aged 6-7. We adapted these instruments to the needs of 6-7-year-old children, by simplification of items, oral rather than written assessment, and reducing the number of conditions and items. Depending on their feasibility and reliability, these instruments will also be used to investigate if reward responsiveness and optimism are associated with mental and social functioning in young children. We aim to include 70 children aged 6-7. Data collection was originally planned in March and April 2020, but has been postponed due to Corona virus regulations. We expect to collect the data in the first half of 2021.","tags":["Mental health","Mental functioning","Social functioning","Positive bias","Reward responsiveness","Optimism","Children"],"title":"Reward Responsiveness, Optimism, and Social and Mental Functioning in Children Aged 6-7: Protocol of a Cross-Sectional Pilot Study","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Charlotte Vrijen","Catharina A.

Positieve informatie roept vaak sterke reacties op, maar niet bij iedereen. Wie minder sterk reageert op positieve informatie heeft een zogenaamde lage positieve bias. In dit onderzoek is nagegaan of zo’n lage positieve bias tijdens de adolescentie een voorspeller is van latere depressie en wat de implicaties zijn van een lage positieve bias in het dagelijks leven. Daarnaast is een interventiestudie uitgevoerd onder jongvolwassenen die last hadden van verlies van plezier om na te gaan of een op de persoon toegesneden leefstijladvies en een vrije-val-ervaring zouden leiden tot meer plezier en een positievere bias bij deze jongeren. Een belangrijke uitkomst was dat een lage positieve bias gedurende de adolescentie een latere depressie voorspelt en daarmee mogelijk een indicator is van vatbaarheid voor depressie. In het dagelijks leven hielden jongeren met een hoge positieve bias het goede gevoel dat ze van positieve ervaringen kregen langer vast dan jongeren met een lage bias. Dit zou kunnen verklaren waarom jongeren met een lage positieve bias meer kans hebben om depressief te worden. In de interventiestudie werden aanwijzingen gevonden dat leefstijladvies op maat resulteerde in meer plezier, maar niet in een positievere bias.","tags":["Mental health","Depression","Positive bias","Biomarkers","Daily life affect dynamics","Personalized lifestyle intervention","Tandem skydive","Adolescents","Young adults"],"title":"Blije gezichten en andere beloningen: aandacht voor positieve informatie als beschermend mechanisme tegen depressie","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Charlotte Vrijen\"","Jennifer Klop-Richards"," Anoek Sluiter-Oerlemans"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1566000000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1566000000,"objectID":"23a572bd55f8b0ed297380cd55bc4b95","permalink":"https://charlottevrijen.com/talk/noorderzon/","publishdate":"2019-08-17T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/noorderzon/","section":"talk","summary":"At Noorderzon 2019 I co-organized the Noorderlichten activity ‘Like parent, like child?’.

It assesses levels of pleasure across different domains (e.g., social, physical). The psychometric properties of the DOPS were tested in two studies (Study 1: N = 2937, Mage = 21.4 years, SD = 1.9; Study 2: N = 1187, Mage = 22.84, SD = 2.23). In line with the multifaceted view of pleasure experiences, comparisons with a one factor solution showed that pleasure may be best investigated domain specific rather than aggregated over all items. Across studies, exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis showed that pleasure was reliably measured in the domains of social pleasure, sexual pleasure, perceptual pleasure, and pleasure in personal achievements. Measurement invariance was established across sex and educational level in Study 1, but not in Study 2. The DOPS is a promising instrument to measure pleasure across different domains and may help researchers and clinicians to pinpoint interventions.","tags":null,"title":"The Domains of Pleasure Scale (DOPS): A novel questionnaire to measure anhedonia","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Charlotte Vrijen"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1557705600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1557705600,"objectID":"ff891e2ce50fbde6e61408d6bc06fc59","permalink":"https://charlottevrijen.com/publication/vrijen-happy-2019/","publishdate":"2020-12-27T15:17:02.215709Z","relpermalink":"/publication/vrijen-happy-2019/","section":"publication","summary":"People generally show strong responses to positive or rewarding experiences, for example, winning a prize or seeing someone smile. However, not all people respond the same to positive information; some people show weaker responses to positive information and stronger responses to negative information. These people show a so-called low positive bias. In 7 different studies, I investigated low positive bias in adolescence as an underlying mechanism of depression with different instruments and from different perspectives, combining longitudinal data collected every 2-3 years with more fine-grained momentary assessments collected three times per day, data from laboratory tasks and salivary biomarkers.\nI studied whether a low bias toward positive information in adolescence predicted later onset of depression and also investigated the daily life implications of a low positive bias. From a treatment perspective, I studied whether tailored lifestyle advice and an extreme free-fall experience (tandem skydive) could be effective in increasing pleasure and implicit positive bias in young adults suffering from loss of pleasure.\nOne of the main findings reported in my dissertation is that low positive bias during early and mid-adolescence predicted onset of depression later in life and may mark vulnerability for depression. In daily life, young adults with a high positive bias sustained their positive emotions and experiences more strongly over time than those with a low happy bias. I further found evidence that tailored lifestyle advice increased self-reported daily pleasure, but no evidence that this intervention also increased positive bias.","tags":["Mental health","Depression","Positive bias","Biomarkers","Daily life affect dynamics","Personalized lifestyle intervention","Tandem skydive","Adolescents","Young adults"],"title":"Happy Faces and Other Rewards: Different Perspectives on a Bias Away from Positive and Toward Negative Information as an Underlying Mechanism of Depression","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Charlotte Vrijen\"","Catharina Hartman","Albertine J.

Little is known about the interrelations between positive emotions and motivation in daily life, and whether these associations are altered in anhedonic individuals. In the present study, we used a network approach to explore the reciprocal, lagged associations between positive emotions and motivation in anhedonic individuals (N = 66) and controls (N = 68). Participants (aged between 18 and 24 years) filled out momentary assessments of affect 3 times per day for 30 consecutive days. Our results showed that (a) anhedonic individuals and controls had similar moment-to-moment transfer of positive emotions; (b) in the anhedonic network feeling cheerful was the node with the highest outstrength, both within this group and compared with the control group; (c) feeling relaxed had the highest outstrength in the control network, and (d) anhedonic individuals had stronger pathways from positive emotions to motivation than controls. Taken together, our findings suggest that low levels of positive emotions lead to decreased motivation in the anhedonic group, which could instigate a negative spiral of low pleasure and low motivation. On a more positive note, we showed that cheerfulness had the highest outstrength in the network of anhedonic participants. Hence, interventions may focus on increasing cheerfulness in anhedonic individuals, as this will likely have the greatest impact on other positive emotions and motivations.","tags":["Anhedonia","Daily Activities","Motivation","Pleasure","Positive Emotions","Rewards"],"title":"Reciprocal associations between positive emotions and motivation in daily life: Network analyses in anhedonic individuals and healthy controls","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Tina Kretschmer","Charlotte Vrijen"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1544572800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1544572800,"objectID":"149fa8d28c0853f01589f45d5b623b07","permalink":"https://charlottevrijen.com/talk/ghosts-from-the-past/","publishdate":"2018-12-12T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/ghosts-from-the-past/","section":"talk","summary":"Presentation of the project Ghosts from the past.

We investigated the effect of an acute stress experience (i.e., a tandem skydive) that was expected to elicit both intense fear and intense euphoria in a sample of anhedonic young adults. Objective (1) To examine individual differences in alpha-amylase reactivity to and recovery from a tandem skydive in anhedonic young adults; (2) to investigate whether trait depressive and anxiety problems, trait positive affect (PA), i.e., level of pleasure and reward responsiveness, and state anxiety, PA and self-esteem prior to the skydive were associated with alpha-amylase reactivity and recovery patterns; (3) to investigate whether alpha-amylase reactivity and recovery patterns were associated with pre- to post-jump changes in state anxiety, PA, and self-esteem. Method Participants were 61 individuals with persistent anhedonia (Mage = 21.38, 78.7% female), who filled out a baseline questionnaire at the start of the study, and momentary questionnaires (3 times per day) before and after the tandem skydive. Alpha-amylase was measured at four time points by means of salivettes (2 before and 2 after the skydive). Results Alpha-amylase reactivity and recovery patterns were highly similar across individuals, although mean levels varied greatly. No associations were found between any of the trait and state measures and reactivity and recovery. Only state self-esteem was affected by the reactivity and recovery patterns, in that individuals who showed high reactivity and low recovery experienced decreases in self-esteem after the skydive. Conclusions Alpha-amylase patterns following a tandem skydive in anhedonic individuals are highly similar to patterns previously found in healthy individuals. Although replication is warranted, our findings tentatively suggest that a strong stress response that cannot be downregulated well predicts a decrease in self-esteem.","tags":["Mental health","Emotions","Biomarkers","Saliva","Anxiety","Cortisol","Psychological stress","Young adults","Depression","Open science"],"title":"Alpha-amylase reactivity and recovery patterns in anhedonic young adults performing a tandem skydive","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"My postdoc is part of Dr. Tina Kretschmer\u0026rsquo;s ERC funded project Ghosts from the Past: Consequences of Adolescent Peer Experiences across Contexts and Generations (CAPE).\nIn this project we investigate whether and how peer experiences are transmitted a) to adult friendships and romantic relationships, and b) across generations, i.e., passed on to offspring, to shed light on how the “ghosts from peer past” affect young adults’ relationships and their children’s early social development.\nOur methods include examining longitudinal links between adolescent peer and young adult close relationships and test whether parents’ peer experiences affect offspring’s peer experiences.

The main aim of this study was to acquire a better understanding of laboratory measures of happy bias by studying how these translate to people’s daily life. We investigated whether stable high and low happy bias during a laboratory task were associated with different daily life affect dynamics (i.e., effects from one time interval of 6 hours to the next). We used multilevel vector autoregressive (VAR) modelling to estimate lag 1 affect networks for the high and low happy bias groups and used permutation tests to compare the two groups. Compared to their peers with a low happy bias, individuals with a high happy bias more strongly sustained the effects of daily life reward experiences over time. Individuals with a high happy bias may use their reward experiences more optimally in daily life to build resources that promote well-being and mental health. Low reward responsiveness in daily life may be key to why individuals who show a low happy bias during laboratory tasks are vulnerable for depression.","tags":["Mental health","Positive bias","Daily life affect dynamics","Young adults"],"title":"Spread the Joy: How High and Low Bias for Happy Facial Emotions Translate into Different Daily Life Affect Dynamics","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Charlotte Vrijen","Hendrika M.

However, both within and between psychiatric problem domains, large variability exists in the types of emotion identification problems that were reported. Moreover, since the domain-specificity of the findings was often not addressed, it remains unclear whether patterns found for specific problem domains can be better explained by co-occurrence of other psychiatric problems or by more generic characteristics of psychopathology, for example, problem severity. In this study, we aimed to investigate associations between emotion identification biases and five psychiatric problem domains, and to determine the domain-specificity of these biases. Data were collected as part of the ‘No Fun No Glory’ study and involved 2,577 young adults. The study participants completed a dynamic facial emotion identification task involving happy, sad, angry, and fearful faces, and filled in the Adult Self-Report Questionnaire, of which we used the scales depressive problems, anxiety problems, avoidance problems, Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) problems and antisocial problems. Our results suggest that participants with antisocial problems were significantly less sensitive to happy facial emotions, participants with ADHD problems were less sensitive to angry emotions, and participants with avoidance problems were less sensitive to both angry and happy emotions. These effects could not be fully explained by co-occurring psychiatric problems. Whereas this seems to indicate domain-specificity, inspection of the overall pattern of effect sizes regardless of statistical significance reveals generic patterns as well, in that for all psychiatric problem domains the effect sizes for happy and angry emotions were larger than the effect sizes for sad and fearful emotions. As happy and angry emotions are strongly associated with approach and avoidance mechanisms in social interaction, these mechanisms may hold the key to understanding the associations between facial emotion identification and a wide range of psychiatric problems.","tags":["Mental health","Depression","Anxiety","Avoidance","Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder","Antisocial","Positive bias","Emotion identification","Young adults"],"title":"Lower Sensitivity to Happy and Angry Facial Emotions in Young Adults with Psychiatric Problems","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Charlotte Vrijen","Catharina A.

Data were collected as part of the TRacking Adolescents’ Individual Lives Survey (TRAILS), and involved 1840 adolescents who participated in a facial emotion identification test at age 11 and were subjected to the World Health Organization Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) at age 19. In a multi-emotion model, slow identification of happy facial emotions tentatively predicted onset of depressive disorder within the follow-up period. Slow identification of happy emotions and fast identification of sad emotions predicted symptoms of anhedonia, but not symptoms of sadness. Our results suggest that the relative speed of identification of happiness in relation to the identification of sadness is a better predictor of depression than the identification of either facial emotion alone. A possible mechanism underlying the predictive role of facial emotion identification may be a less reactive reward system.","tags":["Mental health","Vulnerability","Depression","Positive bias","Emotion identification","Adolescents"],"title":"Slow identification of facial happiness in early adolescence predicts onset of depression during 8 years of follow-up","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Eeske Van Roekel","Maurits Masselink","Charlotte Vrijen","Vera E.

Further, we will explore whether a tandem skydive following the personalized lifestyle advice positively influences anhedonic young adults’ abilities to carry out the recommended lifestyle changes, and whether this ultimately improves their self-reported pleasure.","tags":["Mental health","Depression","Anhedonia","Positive bias","Intervention","Personalized lifestyle advice","Randomized controlled trial","Tandem skydive","Young adults"],"title":"Study protocol for a randomized controlled trial to explore the effects of personalized lifestyle advices and tandem skydives on pleasure in anhedonic young adults","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"My main line of research concerns positive bias, i.e., the phenomenon that many people see the world more brightly and more positive than it really is, and whether and at what ages individual differences in positive bias are associated with differences in mental and social functioning.

G. Collingwood are not commonly associated with each other. From Ryle’s autobiographical essay (1971) we know that he saw Collingwood as an exact personification of pre-war Oxford: stuffy, hermetically closed off and philosophically dull; and, as did most of his analytically minded colleagues in philosophy, Ryle regarded Collingwood’s philosophy as a relic of past metaphysical theory. Collingwood, in turn, never paid any particular attention to Ryle’s philosophical writings, except on one occasion in 1935 when Ryle and Collingwood discussed their philosophical views with one another. At the time, Ryle was a lecturer at Christ Church College in Oxford and was already regarded as a promising philosopher, and Collingwood was Waynflete Professor of Metaphysical Philosophy. The tone in their brief correspondence was often biting and chilly, and the two philosophers seemed to disagree about almost everything. The correspondence between Ryle and Collingwood is discussed in the present article.","tags":[],"title":"Ryle and Collingwood: Their Correspondence and its Philosophical Context","type":"publication"}]
